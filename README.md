### IntelliJ IDEA Tasks integration for ClickUp

#### Description

This plugin integrates ClickUp with IntelliJ IDEA tasks management and time tracking. As Jetbrains Time Tracking bundle
is only available in Ultimate the time tracking functionality is not available in the Community Edition.

If you ever worked with JIRA integration in IntelliJ IDEA you will find this plugin very similar. This plugin enhances
the task management capabilities of IntelliJ IDEA by integrating with ClickUp.

The idea is to bring ALL the task management capabilities of ClickUp to IntelliJ IDEA. This includes creating tasks,
viewing tasks, updating tasks, and tracking time spent on tasks.

#### Features

- Synchronize tasks between ClickUp and IntelliJ IDEA
- Track time spent on tasks
- Create tasks from the IDE
- View tasks in the IDE
- Apply filters to tasks by status, assignee, tags, and more
- Branches and commits are linked to tasks
- Time tracking posts time to tasks in ClickUp

#### Known Bugs

- On the open task dialog the status initially selected is always the first one in the list
- Post tracked time to task does not work - fails with null
